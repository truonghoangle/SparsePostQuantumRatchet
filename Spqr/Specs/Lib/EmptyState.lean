# Spec theorem for `spqr::empty_state`

`empty_state` constructs the canonical V0 (disabled) protocol state: an empty `Vec<u8>`.  When the
SPQR protocol version is `V0` (i.e., `Version::DISABLED`), the serialized state is simply an empty
byte vector — no protobuf encoding is needed, and no key material is generated.

This function is used by `initial_state` when `params.version = V0` and by `decode_state` as the
interpretation of an empty byte slice.

**Spec theorem for `spqr.empty_state`**:

• Takes no arguments.
• Returns `ok (Vec.new U8)` — a freshly allocated empty vector.
• The function always succeeds (no panic, no allocation failure in the Aeneas model).

The result satisfies the emptiness postcondition:

  `result.val = []`

i.e., the returned vector contains no bytes, representing the V0 (disabled) protocol state.
