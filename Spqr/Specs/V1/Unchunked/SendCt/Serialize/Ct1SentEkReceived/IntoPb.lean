/-! # Spec theorem for `spqr::v1::unchunked::send_ct::serialize::Ct1SentEkReceived::into_pb`

Converts a `Ct1SentEkReceived` state from the in-memory Rust form
(`v1.unchunked.send_ct.Ct1SentEkReceived`) into the protobuf form
(`proto.pq_ratchet.v1_state.unchunked.Ct1SentEkReceived`) used for saving
it to disk. The `epoch`, `es` and `ek` fields are copied over unchanged,
the `auth` field is converted with `Authenticator::into_pb` (a plain field
copy) and wrapped in `Some`, and `ct1` is cloned into a fresh vector with
`to_vec` (byte cloning is the identity, so its contents are preserved
exactly). The reverse direction is `from_pb`.

/-- **Spec theorem for `v1.unchunked.send_ct.serialize.Ct1SentEkReceived.into_pb`**:

• The call always succeeds (no panic).
• The result's `epoch`, `es`, `ek` and `ct1` equal the corresponding
  fields of `self` (cloning the `ct1` byte vector preserves it exactly).
• The result's `auth` is `some` of the protobuf form of `self.auth`,
  carrying the same `root_key` and `mac_key`. -/
