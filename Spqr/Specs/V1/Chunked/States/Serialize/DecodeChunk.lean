/-! # Spec theorem for `spqr::v1::chunked::states::serialize::decode_chunk`

`decode_chunk` reads a `Chunk` from the byte buffer `from` at cursor `at`, advancing the cursor
past the bytes it consumed.  A chunk is serialized as

  `[varint(index)] ++ [data (32 bytes)]`

so decoding is `decode_varint` followed by a verbatim 32-byte read; the chunk index is rejected
if it does not fit in a `u16`.

We prove functional correctness: on success the index is the LEB128 decoding (`varintVal`) of
the `n` bytes consumed by `decode_varint`, the payload is exactly the next 32 bytes of the
buffer, and the cursor ends at `at + n + 32`, still within the buffer.  Two points deserve
mention.

* **Precondition.** The extraction drops the source's `hax_lib::assume!(*at < usize::MAX - 32)`,
  so `*at += 32` is a fallible addition.  We discharge it from `from.len() + 32 ≤ usize::MAX`,
  which is weaker than a bound on the entry cursor: `decode_varint` already guarantees
  `at ≤ from.len()` on the path where the addition happens.
* **Cursor on failure.** The source mutates `*at` *before* the bounds check, so on the two
  error paths of `decode_chunk` itself the cursor has already advanced by `n + 32` — unlike
  `decode_varint`, which leaves it untouched on failure.  Hence the postcondition only claims
  monotonicity `at ≤ *future(at)`, not `*future(at) = at`, in the error case.  This is what the
  caller `Message::deserialize` relies on: its `ensures` constrains the cursor on success only.

Unlike the other specs in this directory, the axiom closure of `decode_chunk_spec` contains two
extra axioms, both coming from the extracted `.expect("correct size")` in the function body and
not from the proof: Aeneas models `core::fmt::Formatter` as an opaque type (`axiom`), and its
`toStr` discharges the string-literal length side condition with `by decide +native`, whose
`native_decide` axiom is shared through the first extraction site,
`chain.ChainEpochDirection.next_key_internal._proof_6`.

/-- `chunkBlockAt bytes start n c`: bytes `start, …, start + n + 31` lie inside `bytes` and
form a chunk block — a LEB128 block of `n` bytes decoding to `c.index` (`varintBlockAt`)
followed by the 32 payload bytes `c.data`.  These are exactly the success conjuncts of
`decode_chunk_spec` below. -/

/-- **Spec theorem for `spqr::v1::chunked::states::serialize::decode_chunk`**:

The cursor never moves backwards and, on success, `decode_chunk` consumed a varint of `n` bytes
(`1 ≤ n ≤ 10`) followed by the 32-byte payload, all within the buffer: the cursor ends at
`at + n + 32 ≤ from.len()`, the chunk index is the LEB128 decoding of the varint bytes — so
the decoded value fits in a `u16`, since `c.index` does — and the chunk payload is exactly
`from[at + n .. at + n + 32]`.  On failure the error is `MsgDecode`.

The varint block is characterized by the shared `varintBlockAt` predicate, so the byte-level
conjuncts — byte `n-1` is the terminator (high bit clear) and bytes `0, …, n-2` are
continuation bytes (high bit set) — are literally the ones `decode_varint_spec` establishes.
They are what pins `n` down to a single value for a given buffer, so a future roundtrip
theorem against `encode_chunk` can identify the varint block it produced. -/
