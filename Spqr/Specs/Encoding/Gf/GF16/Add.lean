# Spec theorem for `spqr::encoding::gf::{impl ops::Add for GF16}::add`

In GF(2¹⁶) — the Galois field with 65 536 elements — addition is
simply bitwise XOR of the two 16-bit underlying values.  This follows
from the fact that GF(2¹⁶) has characteristic 2, so addition of
polynomial coefficients is addition in GF(2), which is XOR.

The by-value `Add<GF16> for GF16` introduces no additional logic
beyond the delegation, so its postcondition is inherited from the
corresponding `AddAssign` specification.

Note that in GF(2¹⁶), addition and subtraction coincide:
  `a + b = a - b = a ⊕ b`
since every element is its own additive inverse (`a + a = 0`).

/-- **Spec theorem for `spqr.encoding.gf.GF16.Insts.CoreOpsArithAddGF16GF16.add`**:

• Takes two `GF16` field elements `self` and `other`, each wrapping
  a `u16` value representing an element of GF(2¹⁶).
• Delegates immediately to `add_assign`:
    `CoreOpsArithAddAssignShared0GF16.add_assign self other`
  which computes `self.value ^^^ other.value` (bitwise XOR).
• Returns the resulting `GF16` whose `value` field is the GF(2¹⁶)
  sum of the two inputs.

• The function always succeeds (no panic) for any valid pair of
  GF16 inputs, since XOR is a total operation on bounded integers.
• The by-reference `Add<&GF16>::add` delegates to this
  by-value variant and is observationally identical.
• Together with the `AddAssign` trait implementation, the following
  identity holds:
    `(a + b).value = add_assign(a, b).value`

The result satisfies the GF(2¹⁶)-level postcondition:

  `result.value.val.toGF216 =
       self.value.val.toGF216 + other.value.val.toGF216`

where `Nat.toGF216 n = φ (natToGF2Poly n)` interprets a natural
number as an element of `GF216 = GaloisField 2 16` via the chosen
ring homomorphism `φ : GF2Poly →+* GF216` that vanishes on
`POLY_GF2`.

The proof unfolds `add` to expose the underlying `add_assign` call
and discharges the resulting goal with `step*`, which applies the
already-registered `add_assign_spec`.

/-- **Spec theorem for `spqr.encoding.gf.GF16.Insts.CoreOpsArithAddShared0GF16GF16.add`**:

• Takes two `GF16` field elements `self` and `other`, each wrapping
  a `u16` value representing an element of GF(2¹⁶).
  In the original Rust source `other` is passed by reference
  (`&GF16`); after Aeneas extraction the reference is erased and
  both arguments are plain `GF16` values.
• Delegates immediately to the by-reference `add_assign`:
    `CoreOpsArithAddAssignShared0GF16.add_assign self other`
  which computes `self.value ^^^ other.value` (bitwise XOR).
• Returns the resulting `GF16` whose `value` field is the GF(2¹⁶)
  sum of the two inputs.

• The function always succeeds (no panic) for any pair of `GF16`
  inputs, since XOR is a total operation on bounded integers.
• Lifting `result.value.val` into `GF216` via the canonical map
  `Nat.toGF216 = φ ∘ natToGF2Poly` yields the GF(2¹⁶) sum of the
  similarly-lifted inputs:
    `(result.value.val.toGF216 : GF216) =
        self.value.val.toGF216 + other.value.val.toGF216`
  where the `+` on the right-hand side is addition in
  `GF216 = GaloisField 2 16`.

The result satisfies the GF(2¹⁶)-level postcondition:

  `(result.value.val.toGF216 : GF216) =
       self.value.val.toGF216 + other.value.val.toGF216`

where `Nat.toGF216 n = φ (natToGF2Poly n)` interprets a natural
