/-! # Spec theorem for `spqr::encoding::polynomial::CHUNK_SIZE`

In Protocol V1, plaintext data is split into fixed-size chunks of 32 bytes before being encoded via
erasure coding over GF(2¹⁶). Each 2-byte pair within a chunk corresponds to a single GF(2¹⁶)
element, so a 32-byte chunk yields `CHUNK_SIZE / 2 = 16` field elements (see `NUM_POLYS`).

This constant records that chunk size: `CHUNK_SIZE = 32#usize`
